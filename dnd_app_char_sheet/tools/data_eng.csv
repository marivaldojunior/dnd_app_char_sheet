as a table, floor, wall, etc.) or in an object that can be closed to hide the rune (such as a book, scroll, treasure chest, etc.). If you specify a
surface, the rune can cover an area of up to 10 feet in diameter. If you specify an object, it must stay where it is; if the object is moved
more than 10 feet from the cast location, its rune is destroyed and the spell ends immediately without being triggered. · The rune is nearly
invisible and requires an
Intelligence (Investigation) check at the spell's saving throw DC to be discovered. You set the triggering conditions for
the rune when you cast the spell. Typical triggering conditions for runes carved on a surface include: touching or standing on the rune;
removing the object covering the rune; entering a certain casting distance of the rune; manipulating the object on which the rune is located.
Typical triggering conditions for runes carved inside an object include: opening the object; approaching the object a certain
distance; seeing or reading the rune. You can further refine the triggering conditions, such as setting specific conditions for the spell to be
triggered, or setting the triggering person to have specific physical characteristics (height and weight, etc.), a specific creature type (for
example, set it to affect only aberrations or drow), or a specific alignment. You can also exclude
people with specific conditions from being able to trigger the rune, such as someone who speaks a specific command. When you carve
the rune, you can choose one of the following options as the effect of the spell. Once the rune is triggered, it will begin to glow, causing a
60-foot-radius sphere around it to be dimly illuminated for 10 minutes. After this period of time, the spell ends. When the rune is in effect,
all creatures in the sphere become targets of the spell's effects. A creature
also becomes a target of the rune's effects the first time it enters the sphere during its turn or the first time it ends its turn in the sphere.

creature for the duration of the spell. Your new form can be any creature with a challenge rating equal to or less than your level. The
creature can't be a construct or undead, and you must have seen it before at least once. You become a normal member of that
creature, without any class levels or spellcasting features. · Your game data is replaced by
the target creature's statistics, but your alignment, as well as your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, remain unchanged.
You also retain all your proficiency with skills and saving throws, and gain the target creature's proficiency with skills and saving
throws. If the target creature and you both have a proficiency, and the target creature has a higher proficiency bonus with that skill
than you do, you use the higher proficiency bonus instead of your own for that skill.
You can’t use your new form’s legendary actions or lair actions. Your hit points and hit dice become the same as your new form.
When you revert to your original form, your hit points return to what they were before the transformation. If you revert because your
hit points dropped below 0, your normal form takes all the extra damage. You don’t
fall unconscious as long as the damage isn’t enough to reduce your normal hit points to 0. You still gain the benefits of your class
features, racial traits, and other traits, as long as your new form is physically able to do them. You can’t use any special senses you
had before (such as darkvision) unless your new form has them. If the creature you’re
transformed into can’t normally speak, you can’t speak. When you transform, you can choose to have your gear fall to the ground,
merge with your new form, or remain on. Gear that remains on still functions normally. The DM should decide whether you can keep
each piece of gear on in your new form, based on the shape and size of your new form. Your equipment does not change shape or
size to accommodate your new form, and equipment that cannot be worn in your new
form must be dropped to the ground or integrated into your new form. Equipment integrated into the new form has no effect. ·
During the spell's duration, you can use your action to change into another form. The rules and restrictions of reshaping are the
same as the first time, with one exception: if the new form has more hit points than your current form, your hit points remain unchanged. ",Shapechange,,,√,,,,
The target uses the hit points of its new form. When it returns to its normal form, the target's hit points return to their original value. If the
target returns to its normal form because it was reduced to 0 hit points, the target takes any extra damage from the damage. As long as the
extra damage is not enough to reduce the target's hit points to 0, the
target does not fall unconscious. The creature's actions are limited by the characteristics of its new form; it cannot speak, cast spells, or
perform any actions that require its hands or speech unless its physical
characteristics allow it to do so. The target's equipment merges with its new form, and it cannot activate or hold equipment or otherwise
benefit from its equipment. Object to Creature: You can transform an object into any creature that meets the following requirements: The
creature must be no larger than the original object and have a challenge rating of 9 or less. The transformed creature is friendly to you and your
companions. It takes your turn in combat to decide how it acts. The GM controls the creature's statistics and determines the consequences of its actions.

of frost damage. Ranged weapon attacks are unavailable in the area. The strong winds and heavy rain within the area severely interfere with
maintaining spell concentration. In addition, strong winds (20 to 50 miles per hour) in the area automatically disperse any magical or nonmagical

You can manipulate the foundations of reality simply by speaking your wish aloud. ·The most basic use of this spell is to imitate
any spell of 8th level or lower. You do not need to meet any prerequisites of
the target spell (including expensive material components) for the
spell to work. ·In addition, you can also choose to create one of the following effects: √You create an object worth no more than
25,000 gp. The object cannot be a magic item. The longest dimension of the
object cannot exceed 300 feet, and it appears on the ground at the time of the spell

make up to ten creatures you can see resistant to a type of damage you specify √ You make up to ten creatures you can see
immune to a spell or other magical effect for
eight hours. For example, you can make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's drain life. √ You alter an event that
just happened. Reroll any die roll from the previous round (including the one you made the previous round) and cause reality to
change according to your new roll. For example, a wish spell can undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or an
ally's failed save.
You can force the reroll to have advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the rerolled result or the
original result. · You may be able to achieve other results in addition to the example effects listed above. You can explain your
wish in detail to the DM, who will make the decision. However, the larger your wish, the greater the chance of error. The spell
may fail, or it may partially achieve the result you want, or you may suffer unexpected results if you word your wish improperly.
For example, wishing for the death of a villain might transport you to a time many years later when that
person is dead, effectively leaving the game. Also, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport
you to the object's current owner. Casting this spell for any purpose other than to mimic another spell places a heavy burden on
you. While burdened, you take damage (1d10 points of necrotic damage per level of the spell you cast) each time you cast a spell
until you finish a long rest. You can't mitigate or prevent this damage in any way, and your Strength score drops to 3 in 2d4 days
(unless it's already 3 or lower). During this time, for every full day you spend resting (not doing any strenuous work), the number of
days it takes to recover decreases by 2. Finally, if you take on this burden, you have a 33% chance of never being able to cast Wish again. ",Wish,,,,,√,,√,,,,If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. Thereafter, the creature becomes
